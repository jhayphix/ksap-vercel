ðŸ’¡ Example JSX Component (Bootstrap-based):

const ExternalScholarshipCard = ({ scholarship }) => {
  const {
    name,
    description,
    deadline,
    url,
    sponsor,
    logoUrl,
    location,
  } = scholarship;

  return (
    <Card className="h-100 shadow-sm external-scholarship-card">
      {logoUrl && (
        <Card.Img
          variant="top"
          src={logoUrl}
          alt={`${sponsor} logo`}
          style={{ maxHeight: "120px", objectFit: "contain", padding: "1rem" }}
        />
      )}

      <Card.Body>
        <Card.Title className="text-truncate">{name}</Card.Title>
        <Card.Subtitle className="mb-2 text-muted">{sponsor}</Card.Subtitle>
        <Card.Text className="text-truncate">
          {description?.substring(0, 120)}...
        </Card.Text>
        {location && <Badge bg="info" className="mb-2">{location}</Badge>}
        <p className="text-danger small mb-2">Deadline: {new Date(deadline).toDateString()}</p>
        <Button
          variant="primary"
          href={url}
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Apply Now
        </Button>
      </Card.Body>
    </Card>
